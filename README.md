# Welcome to Framework DevBox!

Tired of spending hours setting up a new web framework just to try it out? **Framework DevBox** is your solution.

This repository is a curated collection of the best modern web frameworks, pre-packaged into Docker containers with hot-reloading enabled out of the box. It's the ultimate playground for developers, tech writers, and architects who want to explore, learn, and compare technologies without the setup pain.

**Focus on what matters — your code — not the configuration.**

### What's Inside?

**Docker-Powered**: Clean, reproducible, and isolated environments for every stack.
**Blazing-Fast Workflow**: Write code in your favorite IDE on your local machine; the app inside the container updates automatically.
**Polyglot Playground**: From Python's FastAPI to Rust's Actix Web, explore a diverse "zoo" of technologies.
**Side-by-Side Comparison**: The perfect tool to write your next comparison article or choose the right stack for your new project.
